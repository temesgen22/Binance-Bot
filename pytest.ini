# Markers for test categorization
markers =
    slow: marks tests as slow (excluded from CI due to CPU/resource limitations)
    ci: marks tests as critical/essential tests that MUST run in CI (fast and important)
    integration: marks tests as integration tests
    unit: marks tests as unit tests
    database: marks tests that require a database connection

# Tests are NOT run by default during deployment (CPU resource limitations)
# To run tests manually:
#   - Run CI tests: pytest -m ci
#   - Run all tests: pytest -m ""
#   - Run slow tests: pytest -m slow
# addopts = -m ci  # Commented out - tests excluded during deployment
